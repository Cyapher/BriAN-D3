This repository is dedicated to the implementation of our undergraduate thesis, which addresses a crucial issue in road safety â€“ driver drowsiness. 

Driving is an essential skill that offers convenience and independence, yet it also comes with inherent risks, including driver fatigue. Our research focuses on developing a Multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) to enhance the adaptability of driver drowsiness detection. By incorporating tasks such as Facial Landmark Identification, Illuminance Estimation, and Video Correction, our system aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of detecting drowsiness in various environmental conditions. 

Our primary goal is to create a system that leverages MCNN to improve the adaptability of driver drowsiness detection, particularly in response to changing lighting conditions and environmental factors. By evaluating the model's performance and its ability to outperform existing approaches, we aim to enhance safety on the road. This research carries significance for both the transportation sector, where drivers can benefit from advanced drowsiness detection technology, and the field of Computer Science, where it contributes to the knowledge base of Machine Learning and data processing techniques for real-world applications.
